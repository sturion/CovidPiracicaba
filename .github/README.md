# CovidPiracicaba - DESATIVADO (ALGORITMO OBSOLETO)

Welcome!

The number of cases of COVID-19 has been increasing as the days go by and with the intention of raising awareness among the population of Piracicaba, a web system project was created that not only informs users about the real data of the virus, but also enables these same users manipulate some data so that they can have a future vision of the virus growth based on scientific and previously tested formulas.

Feel free to collaborate with this project. Whether creating a version for your own city, pointing out problems as specified by the security protocol or proposing various improvements to the platform.

Don't forget to read the license for use and the community's conduct guidelines.
